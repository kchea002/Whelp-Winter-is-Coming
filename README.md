Welp: Winter Is Coming, is a clone of the website Yelp with a Game of Thrones theme. Users are able to write reviews for the various businesses found throughout Westeros.

This project was designed and built within 10 days, and I plan to continue to implement new improvements over time. 

## Features

* Secure user authentication created with BCrypt.
* Users can see various businesses throughout Westeros, along with their reviews.
* User is able to create only one review for a business and delete it.

## Possible Future Features
 *   search functionality
*     google map integration
*     edit reviews and upload photos
