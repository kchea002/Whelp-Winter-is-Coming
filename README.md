Welp: Winter Is Coming, is a clone of the website Yelp with a Game of Thrones theme. Users are able to write reviews for the various businesses found throughout Westeros.

This project was designed and built within 10 days, and I plan to continue to implement new improvements over time. 


## Technologies
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* React.js/ Redux
* HTML5 and CSS3 

## Features

* Secure user authentication created with BCrypt.
* Users can see various businesses throughout Westeros, along with their reviews.
* User is able to create only one review for a business and delete it.

### Search 

Users are able to search for businesses by typing the business name or location in Westeros in the search bar. If a user either enters a location that cannot be found or a empty location, the search button will return a list of all the businesses.
